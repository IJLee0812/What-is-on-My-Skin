## I. Project Name and Description
---

"What's on My Skin" is an **AI algorithm-based** facial skin disease prediction and treatment suggestion system. 

<br>

I've developed a system that allows patients with skin conditions to upload a facial photo and determine whether their skin is normal(정상 피부), has acne(여드름), acne scars(여드름 흉터), or hyperpigmentation(색소침착).

<br>

After analyzing the patient’s skin condition, the system provides the analysis results along with solutions for each specific skin disease.

<br>

## II. Project Duration and Milestones
---

- 24.07.15 ~ 24.07.28: Investigated detailed classification of each symptoms and identified solutions; gathered facial skin disease datasets for each symptom.

- 24.07.29 ~ 24.07.31: Labeled datasets, performed data preprocessing and augmentation.

- 24.08.02 ~ 24.08.15: Conducted model development and training, followed by testing and performance evaluation to optimize the model.

- 24.08.16 ~ 24.08.22: Developed and finalized a demo version of the web service.

## ETC. Development Considerations (AI Focus)
--- 


 I manually collected 250 facial images for each of the three skin diseases as well as normal skin. 
 
 <br>

 Due to the limitations in the dataset size that an individual can gather, data augmentation techniques were applied. 
 
 <br>

 The CNN algorithm used was a pretrained DenseNet121.
